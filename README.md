# # Refactoring Horiseon Mockup Project

This mockup project was created to help students take a long list of code and improving it, making it more managable and simple to read. Changing <div> tags into semantic tags to make it more organzied. Changing the CSS stylesheet to make it more managable and organized, reducing a lot of repeatative code. This project has helped me learn to stay organize with your code.
